It loosely follows the MVC pattern and\r\nadheres to the Don’t Repeat Yourself principle, which makes a database-driven\r\napplication efficient and highly scalable, and is by far the most popular and mature\r\nPython web framework.\r\n\r\nAuthors\r\n\r\n* [Ratan Kumar](http://www.ratankumar.org/)\r\n* [Sanjeev Kumar Jaiswal](http://www.aliencoders.org/)\r\n\r\nHow to use this code repository:\r\n* Have Git installed (https://git-scm.com/)\r\n\r\nSetup The Project repository on your local machine by cloning it :\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/ratancs/learning-django-web-development.git\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What's inside The Book\r\nThis book is a manual that will help you build a simple yet an effective Django web application. It starts by introducing Django, setting it up, and code simple programs. You will then learn to build your first Twitter-like app. Later on you will be introduced to HashTags, Ajax to enhance the user interface, and tweets. You will then move on to create an administration interface, learn database connectivity, and use third-party libraries. \r\nThen you will learn to debug and deploy Django projects, and also get a glimpse of Django with AngularJS and ElasticSearch. By the end of the book you will be able to leverage Django framework to develop a fully functional web application with minimal efforts.\r\n\r\n### Chapter 1\r\nIntroduction to Django gives you an introduction to MVC web development frameworks, a history of Django, and explains why Python and Django are the best tools to use to achieve the aim of this book.\r\n\r\n### Chapter 2\r\nGetting Started shows how to set up our development environment on UNIX/Linux, Windows and Mac OS X.
